### Beacuse claude code included some invalid checks, I figured I'd add the legit ones here
    
#Default Enabled Checks
#dangling-service: Indicates when services do not have any associated deployments.
#deprecated-service-account-field: Flags use of the deprecated serviceAccount field (use serviceAccountName instead).
#docker-sock: Alerts on deployments with docker.sock mounted in containers, which can allow for host control.
#drop-net-raw-capability: Indicates when containers do not drop the NET_RAW capability.
#duplicate-env-var: Ensures that duplicate named environment variables are not passed to a deployment.
#env-var-secret: Indicates when raw secrets are used in environment variables, recommending file mounts or secretKeyRef instead.
#host-ipc: Alerts on pods/deployment-likes that share the host's IPC namespace.
#host-network: Alerts on pods/deployment-likes that share the host's network namespace.
#host-pid: Alerts on pods/deployment-likes that share the host's process namespace.
#invalid-target-ports: Indicates when deployments or services use port names that violate specifications (RFC 6335).
#job-ttl-seconds-after-finished: Checks ttlSecondsAfterFinished for standalone Jobs (should be set) and CronJobs (should be unset).
#latest-tag: Indicates when a container uses the latest image tag instead of a specific version.
#liveness-port: Indicates when a liveness probe targets a port that is not exposed.
#mismatching-selector: Flags when deployment selectors fail to match the pod template labels.
#no-anti-affinity: Ensures deployments with multiple replicas specify inter-pod anti-affinity.
#no-extensions-v1beta: Indicates when objects use deprecated API versions under extensions/v1beta.
#no-read-only-root-fs: Indicates when containers are running without a read-only root filesystem.
#non-existent-service-account: Flags when pods reference a service account that does not exist.
#pdb-max-unavailable / pdb-min-available: Checks PodDisruptionBudgets for values that would prevent all disruptions.
#pdb-unhealthy-pod-eviction-policy: Recommends explicitly setting unhealthyPodEvictionPolicy to AlwaysAllow.
#privilege-escalation-container: Alerts on containers that allow privilege escalation.
#privileged-container: Indicates when containers run in privileged mode.
#readiness-port: Indicates when a readiness probe targets a port that is not exposed.
#run-as-non-root: Ensures containers are configured to run as a non-root user.
#sensitive-host-mounts: Alerts on containers with sensitive host system directories mounted.
#ssh-port: Indicates when port 22 is exposed.
#startup-port: Indicates when a startup probe targets a port that is not exposed.
#unsafe-sysctls: Alerts on deployments specifying unsafe sysctls.
#unset-cpu-requirements: Flags containers without CPU requests and limits set.
#unset-memory-requirements: Flags containers without memory requests and limits set. 

#Notable Disabled Checks (can be enabled via configuration) 
#access-to-secrets: Restricts access to secrets to the smallest possible group of users.
#default-service-account: Indicates when pods use the default service account, recommending a dedicated one.
#no-liveness-probe: Recommends specifying a liveness probe in containers.
#no-readiness-probe: Recommends specifying a readiness probe in containers.
#read-secret-from-env-var: Recommends reading secrets from mounted files over environment variables.
#schema-validation: Validates Kubernetes resources against their schemas using kubeconform.
#use-namespace: Ensures resources are not deployed to the default namespace.
